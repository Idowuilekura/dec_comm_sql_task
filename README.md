# Employee Working Hours 

Write a query to calculate the working hours, minutes, and seconds between each 'In' and 'Out' for each employee.

Results should include the columns employee_id, employee_name, department, designation, at_date and at_time (In), at_data and at_time (Out), and working hours. See the output under Sample Data Tables below for the correct format to use. Be sure to match the format exactly. The output should be ordered by the employee id, then by the working hours start date/time, both ascending.

Note: *The requirement is to calculate the amount of time in hours, minutes, and seconds between each In and Out, for each Employee. While there is usually a matching Out row for each In, sometimes there is an In with no Out or an Out with no In. In either of these cases, omit the data from the result.*

Check the scripts folder for the SQL script to create and insert records into the tables (for PostgresSQL)
